### Hey, i am Manuel
I am currently building Web Applications and exploring different topics in the wide field of Machine Learning and Data Science.

### My beginnings in computer science
When I was 13, I got interested in computer science for the first time. Back then, I taught myself Java with the help of YouTube, because I wanted to program a mod for my favorite game at the time (Minecraft). It was then that I first developed my passion for programming. After losing interest in the game, I started developing Android Apps together with my Brother. We wanted to develop the next big social media app, which we naively imagined to be a bit easier at the time. However, this had the huge advantage that I learned a lot about different information technology concepts, programming languages and libraries at a very early stage. For example, when I was 16, I programmed an interactive 3D globe for our app using Open GL ES, which introduced me to many more complex concepts such as rendering, shader code, tessellation, and many matrix and vector multiplications. After realizing that PHP is not the best language for larger web applications, I started to build web applications with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). Since then, I have been building web applications on the side.
