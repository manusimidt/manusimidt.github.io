## My Bachelor Thesis
At the end of my bachelor degree in business informatics at OTH Regensburg I wrote my bachelor thesis about "Financial reporting in the digital age".
In my thesis I discuss the XBRL standard and its technical structure. I also developed the [Python XBRL parser "py-xbrl"](https://pypi.org/project/py-xbrl/) while writing my thesis.
To demonstrate the capabilities of the XBRL standard, I processed and analyzed tens of thousands annual and quarterly reports (10-K and 10-Q) using "py-xbrl".

Unfortunately, my entire thesis is only available in German.
